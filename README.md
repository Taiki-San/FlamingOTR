# FlamingOTR

A small library able to inject into Flamingo and to add OTR support

# Install

In order to run FlamingOTR, you have to download your own Flamingo.app, which is sadly [not available anymore for download on the AppStore][flamingo-website].

I was in touch with the developer who mentioned he could be considering open sourcing the project in the future, but wouldn't give a date, or even a formal commitment.

The end result is a .app, with the original .app within.
